# CIA - Confidentiality Integrity Availability
# Foundation of Cybersecuity domain 

## Confidientiality
Confidentiality relates to permitting authorized access to information, while at the same time protecting information from improper disclosure.

It is a difficult balance to achieve when system users are guests or customers, and it is not known if they are accessing the system form a compromised machine or vulnerable moblie application.

So, the security professional’s obligation is to regulate access—protect the data that needs protection, yet permit access to authorized individuals.

**PII** (Personally identifiale Information) is a term related to the are of confidentiality. It pertains to data that is used to **identify the individual**

**PHI** (Proteded Health Information) information regarding one's **health status**, and classified or sesitive information, which includes trade screts, research, business plans and intellectual property.

## Integrity
Integrity is the property of information whereby it is recorded, used and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency and usefulness for a stated purpose

**Data Integrity** is the assurance that data has not been tampered in an unauthorised manner. It covers data in storage, during porcessing and while in transit

**System Integrity** refers to the maintenance of a known good configuration and expected operational function as the system processes the information

Enusuring integrity begins with an awareness of **state**, which is current condition of the system. Specifically, this awareness concerns the ability to document and understand the state of data or a system at a certain point, creating a **baseline**

## Availability
Availability means that systems and data are accessible at the time users need them.

1. Timely and Reliable access to information and the ability to use it
2. For authorized users only

Availability is often associated with the term **criticality**, because it represents the importance an organization gives to data or an information system in performing its operations or achieving its mission.
