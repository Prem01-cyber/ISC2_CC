# Risk Management Process

## Risk Identification
It’s a recurring process of identifying different possible risks, characterizing them and then estimating their potential for disrupting the organization.  

- Identify risk to communicate clearly
- Employees at all levels of the organisation are responsible for identifying risks
- Identify risk to protect against it


## Risk Assessment
The process of identifying, estimating and prioritizing risks to an organization’s operations (including its mission, functions, image and reputation), assets, individuals, other organizations and even the nation.

The result of the risk assessment process is often documented as a report or presentation given to management for their use in prioritizing the identified risk(s)

This report is then provided to the management for approval

## Risk Treatment
Risk treatment relates to making decisions about the best actions to take regarding the identified and prioritized risk.

The decisions made are dependent on the attitude of management toward risk and availablity and cost of risk mitigation

### Risk Avoidance (Eliminate)
Attempt to eliminate the risk entirely, this is chosen if the impact of given risk is too high

### Risk Acceptance or Risk Tolerance or Risk appetite
Taking no action to reduce the likelyhood of risk, maybe the impact is low

### Risk Mitigation (Reduce)
Most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact. Involves remedition measures, or security controls, establishing policies, procedures and standards to minimize adverse risk.

### Risk Transfer
Passing the risk to another party, who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically an **insurance policy**
